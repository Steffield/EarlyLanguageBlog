      <h3><b>Multiple Languages at Home</b></h3>
      <h5>Did you know that only 40% of the world are monolingual? Here are some tips on how to help your child to become bi- or multilingual,  <span class="w3-opacity">January 6, 2020</span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      
      <p>I will share with you some of the most effective ways in promoting the acquisition of multiple languages at once. To sum those up, for the ones with no time for the "READ MORE" button, try to create opportunities and the need for your child to engage in the minority language (the language that is not spoken by the child's environment) in as many contexts as possible.</p><span id="dots">...</span>
      <span id= "more"><ul>
        <li><h6>Books</h6> 
          <p>Read to your child in both languages and OFTEN! Try to get some books in the minority language too, but in case you don't have any, translate the gist of the story from a book you have and ask questions and talk about the pictures in the minority language.</p> </li>
        <li><h6>Music</h6> 
          <p>It's a fun way to introduce languages with music and singing songs. You will be surprised how fast your child will sing along no matter the language. </p></li>
        <li><h6>Environment</h6> 
          <p>The more your child is around and gets input from native speakers of the minority language he/she is supposed to learn, the better. Get the grandparents who are native speakers to stick to that language with your child and find some programs where your child can be around other kids speaking that language, because kids love to learn from their peers.</p></li>
        <li><h6>Be Yourself</h6> 
          <p>If it is extremely unnatrural for you to speak the language that you want your child to learn, you will most likely have problems to stick with it. You will give your child the highest quality of input in terms of vocabulary,grammar, correct language use etc., if you use the language you know best with your child. Your child might speak a different language in school than the one you know best and that is totally fine. </p></li>
        <li><h6>Pride in the Second Language and Culture</h6>
          <p>Children don't always like to have a diverse heritage, culture or language. Often they want to be just like their peers and if they don't have peers that are bilingual, it might not be something they are proud of. Try to instill some sort of pride that comes with the language and culture and a need to continue to use it. As mentioned before, finding a community of peers who speak that language can help a lot. </p> </li>
        <li><h6>Literacy in the Second Language</h6> 
          <p>The minority language gets more relevant for your child the more competent he/she is in it. Try to promote biliteracy, if possible.</p>
        <li><h6>Make it a Priority to Provide Minority Language Input</h6>
          <p>I really struggle with that one. I code-switch a lot (alternate between my mother tongue, which is currently the minority language because there is noone else who speaks German to our child, and the majority language, which is English in our case). It is hard not to use the majority language if you are fluent in it, and explains why children often start to respond in the majority language only. So I am saying this to myself too, aim to provide as much opportunity as possible to communicate in the minority language. The common ideas that code-switching shows confusion or that it HAS to be a one person one language approach are slightly outdated. Code switching is normal for a person who is bilingual, but you can potentially make it easier for your child in the early years to differenciate between the two language systems, if you don't do it a lot. One-person one-language works, but if one parent speaks more than one language to the kids, that mostly works, too (De Houwer, 2007). If you managed to create an environment or have grandparents who speak the minority language regularly with your child, it is not as important that you stick to the minority language only. In my case, new in an area and no German contacts, it is more important, to make sure she gets enough German input, so I should make that extra effort to speak more German. In addition, regular visits to Germany and interaction with German family that can only communicate in German will give her the need to learn it.</p>
          <p>Here is an easy read from Psychology Today about the one person - one language approach, by <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/life-bilingual/201504/one-person-one-language-and-bilingual-children" alt="OPOL">Dr. Grosjean (2015)</a></p></li>
        <li><h6>Stick with it! There are SO MANY Benefits!</h6>
          <p>I said it before, it can be quite an effort to stick to the minority language, especially if you are proficient in the majority language as well. It is work to create all those additional opportunies and exposures with the language outside of your home. However, don't give up! There are studies that show that bilingual, biliterate individuals have better executive functioning skills, which impacts the attention processes for solving problems, planning, and performing other mentally demanding tasks, such as reading and writing etc. Here is only a short list of evidence that shows bilinguals have an easier time in areas, such as understanding math concepts and solve word problems (Zelasko & Antunez, 2000), focus, remember and make decisions more easily (Bialystok, 2001), that babies raised in bilingual homes show better self-control, which influences later academic achievement (Kovacs & Mehler, 2009), that there are more job opportunities for bilinguals (Zelasko & Antunez, 2000), and that it even provides a higher resistance to the onset of dementia (Atkinson, 2016). </p></li>
          </li>
        <li><h6>Downsides</h6>
          <p>The upsides definitely outweigh the downsides. However, I wanted to mention the few that could be found. Some data indicates that bilingualism is similar to a dual-task effect and can cause language interference that leads to a slight fluency disadvantage. The two languages seem to constantly compete with each other in our brain, which can slow down the speed of word retrieval in the target language (Sandoval et al.,2010). Also, taking time to speak in a second language to your child does take away time for input in the first language and therefore leads to a slightly lower exposure in both languages than a monolingual child gets.</p></li>
          <br>
      <h6> Final Note</h6>
      <p>I often hear people say that learning a second language simulateously will cause speech or language problems. That is not the case and here is a review paper done by Byers-Heinlein & Lew-Williams (2013) in case you want to know all about it.</p>

      <p>If that topic really excites you and you want a lot more insights you might enjoy those papers by <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1529100610387084" alt="bilingual info">Bialystok et al.(2009)</a>and the one from<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4295724/" alt="great biling paper">Costa & Sebatsian-Galles(2014)</a></p>

      <h5><strong>Attention!!!</strong></h5>
      <p>If your child starts to have issues in both languages, he or she might need to be evaluated by a speech-language pathologist. </p></span>

      <p>I am trying to make this as short and meaningful as possible, but if you have no time to finish this short post, take away this: <strong> Read, read, read to your child</strong> and <strong> say out loud what you are doing</strong>. </p>
      <ul>
        <li><h6> Name, point and describe the things you observe with your child</h6>
          <p><strong>It's a myth that the use of signs and gestures slows down language development!!!</strong></p>
          <p>The opposite is the case. XXX found that children whose parents use baby signs in addition to naming the word, can make the connection between the referent and the phonological representation (the heard word) even quicker. XX found that increased use of gestures xxx</p>
        </li>
        <li><h6>Talk, talk, talk!</h6>
          <p>Eye contact and going down to eye level of your child, while you name, describe, point to or touch things that you see is basically the best thing you can do. Whenever you can, do that! It will help your child learn how to maintain eye contact, an important skill for language development, and will give you both a feeling of connection.</p>
          <p>Listen to sounds and point to where they come from. What sound it is? What animal makes what sound? While on a stroll, describe and point to what you see and name and describe the things your child points to or shows an interest in. You can bombard your child with input in almost every situation. Say out loud what you are doing when you cook, when you dress him/her, tell your child what is going to happen next and later, when you do the same routine again, ask him/her what's going to happen. Even on a lazy rainy day where you watch TV not all is lost (everyone knows its better not to until 3, but let's just be real here). Describe what they are doing on the screen, ask your child what sound that animal in the show is making or what animal it is or ask questions about the show ,like "What's in the monkey's hand?. I could give you a lot of examples, but I think you get the point. The more input the better. Developing routines where your child hears the same words in slighly different sentences are really helpful too. For the one who wants some research to back this up, here are some sources XXXX </p></li>
        <li><h6>Read tou your child OFTEN!</h6>

          </p>

        <li><h6>What NOT to do</h6>
